	Finally got around to doing some major updates and getting ace3 library working with Liquidator. Some changes implemented with this version:

	o Fully upgraded top use Ace3 libraries (still learning so there may be bugs or strange code here and there)
	o Added options to set width and height of the frame
	o Added options to set left and top locations (which should be saved between sessions)
	o Option to change between auction addons (currently supported Auc-Advanced (auctioneer) and Auctionator)

14/FEB/2012 - Aethyn (my son) was born :) - addon dedicated to him coz he's here sleeping making strange noises and keeping me from concentrating.

If you have any suggestions or have bugs to report, please use Curse or Curseforge to submit a ticket (http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/liquidator/create-ticket/)
